## Introduction
In Machine Learning, you only use what you need:
- Suitable for ML:
    - a system with **many manully set rules**.
    - Continually **changing environment**
- Not suitable:
    - Needs to be **explainability** => ML has trained **patterns that is hard to understand**
    - **Rule-based system** is **cost effective** enough
    - The ML system has **unexceptable amount of errors**
    - **Small data**

## 32:05, Learning Paradigm
- Supervised Learning: *sample + lable => patterns* [course-covered-mainly]
- Unsupervised (self-supervised) learning: *samples => patterns > labeled the pattern later* [course-covered-slightly]
- Transfer learning (fine tuning): use the **patterns** learned **by other model**. [course-covered-mainly]

- *Reinforcemeant learning: kind of like Supervised Learning in realtime :v [course-not-covered]

## 43:18, into PyTorch !
- What is PyTorch:
    - Popular (used at Microsoft, Tesla, OpenAI)
    - Full-stack: research + deployment
    - Successor of torch

## 58:01, What will be in this course ? 
    the course is built like a typlical PyTorch workflow.
- PyTorch Basics and Funcdamentals (tensor operations)
- Preprocessing data => tensor
- building and using pretrained deep learning models
- Fitting a model to data 
- Make prediction
- Evaluating model predictions
- Saving/Loading models:
- Using a trained model to make predictions on custom data.

## 1:03:00, how to learn ?
- Code along.
- Visualize what you don't understand.
- Ask dumb questions.
- Exersise
- Chill !
